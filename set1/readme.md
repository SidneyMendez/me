TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I wouldnâ€™t usually go more than half an hour without committing.
Git push is save
This week the test was already given to us to see if the print hello world script works. 
When running the test I found that python and all the necessary libraries were not installed. Therefore I had to go back through the installation process and completely the necessary steps. By doing this, I learnt the basics in what it means for a test to fail, and how to approach fixing it, so the test can pass. 
In addition to that, me not being familiar with the coding environment, I had accidently deleted pushed an older version of the changes made. By going back and making the changes I was happy with, more specifically the changes made in my log book, I had learnt what it meant to save and push content into GitHub. 
Lastly, I don't have a great understanding of what each of the steps did that progressed me into completing the exercise however, I feel I have got a basic understanding of the VS environment.
