This set introduced me to using the range function and its syntax within for loops. I am still trying to wrap my head around for loops and struggling, even though they are meant to be one of the basics. After talking to a peer, I found that the best way to visualize a for loop is to see the indented line under the for loop syntax as the function being looped.

In the first exercise, I learned the structure of a range function. Within the brackets after the range function, the variables are ordered as start, stop, step. This allowed me to specify the variables I want to loop.

As the exercise continued, we were introduced to while loops that included if, else, and elif statements. I feel that I am quite good at understanding these functions since they are basically just the English language. However, I do forget the syntax and how it needs to be written to carry out what I want.

Exercises 2 to 4 were simply harder variations of the basic for loop range functions. Although I felt like I knew the direction to go in relation to what needed to be done, I was still lost on how it should be worded and formatted. I needed to research on Google and use a bit of ChatGPT to help figure out the syntax. This made me realize that I need to revise coding collections, lists, sets, and dictionaries. Some exercises required the use of dictionaries, and I wasnâ€™t too sure how they worked. After that, I learned that **Dictionaries** are collections of `{key: value}` pairs. They are ordered and changeable, with no duplicates.
