TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
As I reflect on Week 9 of my learning journey, I find that it was one of the more challenging weeks, particularly as I delved deeper into using pandas for data analysis and visualization in Python. While I had a solid understanding of the basics of data manipulation with pandas, the task of plotting data and creating visual representations proved to be more difficult than I anticipated.

One of the primary challenges I faced was getting the syntax right when trying to plot data using pandas. The flexibility and power of pandas are incredible, but with that comes a level of complexity that can be daunting when you’re just getting started with more advanced features. I often found myself running into errors or generating plots that didn’t look quite right, which was frustrating.

The process of figuring out how to correctly format the data and apply the appropriate plotting functions took longer than I expected. I realized that while I had a good grasp of pandas for data manipulation, integrating it with plotting libraries like Matplotlib required a different mindset. It wasn’t just about getting the data in the right format but also understanding how the various plotting parameters worked together to produce the desired output.

Despite these difficulties, I gradually began to make progress. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different approaches, reading through documentation, and looking up examples online. The trial-and-error process was tedious, but it was through these struggles that I started to see improvements.
