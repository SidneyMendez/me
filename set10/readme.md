TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
As I look back on my time in this class, I realize just how much I've learned about Python and data analysis. The journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and it's been exciting to see how the skills I've developed can be applied to topics that genuinely interest me.

One of the key takeaways from this class has been mastering simple yet powerful Python techniques. From basic data manipulation to more advanced concepts like working with pandas and plotting data, I've built a solid foundation that I know will be valuable in my future endeavors. Whether it's writing efficient code or solving complex problems, the techniques I've learned here have broadened my understanding of what Python can do.

What made this class particularly engaging was the opportunity to work with data that I'm actually passionate about—chess. Being able to explore and analyze chess data added a personal dimension to my learning experience. It was cool to see how I could apply Python to something I care about, turning abstract concepts into tangible insights that could improve my understanding of the game. This experience has shown me that programming isn't just about solving problems; it's also about discovering new ways to connect with your interests.

Overall, my weeks in this class have been incredibly productive. I've gained practical skills that I can take with me into future projects, and I've learned how to leverage those skills to explore areas that excite me. The ability to combine coding with my personal interests, like chess, has made this learning journey all the more meaningful. I’m looking forward to continuing to build on what I’ve learned and applying these techniques to other areas of interest in the future.
