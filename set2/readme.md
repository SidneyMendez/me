TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
The word printed for exercise 2 was MC Hammer
This week, we covered the basics of coding. We delved into values, variables, expressions, functions, collections, flow control, and loops, all of which are essential for writing code. We learned how to manipulate strings, work with numbers, and handle lists. Additionally, I gained insight into the debugging process, which I now understand consumes a significant portion of coding time.

The main lesson learned is the importance of knowing the right questions to ask to find solutions. For example, converting a string to uppercase is simple once I can clearly articulate what I'm looking for, enabling me to find the answer using a search engine.

I haven't fully grasped the concepts of if, elif, and else statements. I understand that if the code starts, elif continues it, and else ends it, meaning "if nothing else applies." I initially thought that using curly braces would define the components, but I learned that isn't the case. Additionally, I spent a long time figuring out that removing the quotations from the true and false returns in the odd_number exercise changed them from strings to boolean values.

I did something regarding messing up the files. A multitude of problems came up so I decided to copy and paste a fresh version of exercise3 so I can start fresh. I am not sure exactly what I did but the minitests turned into red text, therefore I wasn't able to test all of the tests in exercise3. Through comparing the files it looks like I converted the prompt/instructions for def_loops 7 into a functional module. Overall I was not sure how to convert it back.

After renaming the file back to its original name, I was able to get the test to recognise the new python file.

I finally found out what the issue was that converted def_loops 7 into a functioning module rather than texts. I removed the triple quotation marks that made it only a readable text. Therefore all the copy and pasting for exercise3 was unnecessary.
